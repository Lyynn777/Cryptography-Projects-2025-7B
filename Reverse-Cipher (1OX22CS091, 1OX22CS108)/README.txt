## Project Overview

The Reverse Cipher Web Application is a simple yet effective project designed to demonstrate basic concepts of web development and text manipulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main functionality of this project is to reverse a given text input, showcasing how strings can be handled and modified on the client side without the need for any backend processing. The application features an interactive and user-friendly interface where users can enter text, click the “Reverse” button, and instantly view the reversed output. It also includes additional options such as copying the result to the clipboard, downloading the reversed text as a .txt file, and enabling a “Live Reverse” mode that updates output automatically as the user types. This project helps in understanding fundamental programming concepts like string operations, event handling, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript. The use of HTML ensures proper structure, CSS provides styling for an appealing layout, and JavaScript brings the logic to life. Overall, the Reverse Cipher Web App is a beginner-friendly project suitable for students exploring web technologies and encryption basics, providing a solid foundation for learning more advanced cryptography and frontend development techniques.
